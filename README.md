# Northcoders News API

## Background

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

**Initial Set Up**

Create a `.env.development` and `.env.test` file, using the the `.env-example` file as a template, to ensure the correct database name is used for each environment.  The database names can be found in the `setup.sql` file.  

Then run `npm setup-dbs` to create the database before proceeding.
